CUT-IN Material is based on CUT-IN Manager app. CUT-IN Manger call Materials at the follow cases:

 * Screen turns on.
 * External power is connected.
 * External power os disconnected.
 
So it is easy to make apps. You just need to write animation or some function if you have your own contents.

If you have made an Material app , please message me. CUT-IN Manager have own random advertising area for CUT-IN Materials. It is free and will promote your apps.

Quick Start
---

For a working implementation of this project , add the lib/ as the AndroidLibraryProject and see the sample/ folder.

1. Create a class for showing CUT-IN extends CutinService.

 |return|methods|	description|
 |---|---|---|
 |View	| create |	Create root view which is inflated to full screen window.
 |void	| start |	It is called after create(). At this time view size is possible to get. You must call finishCutin() or stopSelf() after your execution ending.
 |void |	destroy |	Release resources, etc.ã€€
 
2. Copy the sample/cutin/sample/MainActivity and replace these lines to your CutinServices in your onCreate.
 
```java    
 		// Create your CutinService list:
		// cutinName(SAMPLE) used for showing on the display in your app and CUT-IN Manager. 
		ArrayList<CutinItem> list = new ArrayList<CutinItem>();
		list.add(new CutinItem(CutinService1.class, "SAMPLE1"));
		list.add(new CutinItem(CutinService2.class, "SAMPLE2"));
		list.add(new CutinItem(CutinService3.class, "SAMPLE3"));
		mScreen.setCutinList(list);
```

3. AndroidManifest.xml
